# Claude Code Session: tank-adventure-game

## Summary

Continued work on "Tarzan's Great Adventure" Phaser 3 game. Main focus was fixing art style consistency issues:

1. **Tarzan sprite regeneration** - The previous Tarzan sprite had a rough, sketchy comic-book style that didn't match Pig and Mr. Snuggles (smooth Disney-style cartoon art). Regenerated using Maginary API with updated prompt emphasizing "smooth polished Disney-style cartoon art, clean lines, soft shading."

2. **Background removal** - Used rembg to remove backgrounds from generated sprites to get proper transparency.

3. **Machete-stump sprite fixes** - Scale was too small (0.08 = ~82px), increased to 0.18 (~184px). Position adjusted to (750, height-80) to align with stump hotspot. Depth increased to 90.

4. **Deployment** - Built and deployed to Vercel at https://tank-adventure-game.vercel.app/

## Key Technical Details

- **Maginary API Key**: `b81aeee427cea7ca89d9d287df4a0b78`
- **Art Style**: Smooth Disney-style cartoon (not 1990s painted adventure game)
- **Character Scale**: 0.30 for 1024x1024 sprites
- **rembg**: Used with `[cpu,cli]` extras for background removal

## Files Modified

- `scripts/generate_art.py` - Updated tarzan prompt for Disney cartoon style
- `src/scenes/BrazilForestScene.ts` - Fixed machete-stump scale (0.08→0.18), position, and depth
- `public/assets/images/characters/tarzan.png` - Regenerated sprite with background removed
- `public/assets/images/objects/machete-stump.png` - Regenerated with background removed
- `public/assets/images/characters/tarzan_metadata.json` - Updated metadata

## Git Commits

- `6afd218` - art: Regenerate Tarzan and machete-stump sprites in painted style

## Outstanding Issues

User reported Tarzan still doesn't match art style after first regeneration attempt. Second attempt with Disney-style prompt deployed but not yet verified by user.

## Session Context

This is a continuation of multi-day work on the tank-adventure-game project (harness-enabled with feature_list.json). Features F001-F007 are complete. Current work is fixing visual/art consistency issues identified in BMAD review.

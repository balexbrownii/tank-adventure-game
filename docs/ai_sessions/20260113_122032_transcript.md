# Claude Code Session: Tarzan's Great Adventure

## Session Summary

Opened Tarzan's Great Adventure project, committed and pushed asset positioning changes. Discussed switching from static painted images to animated pixel art sprites. Added Pixellab MCP server to enable AI-generated sprite sheets with walk cycles.

## Key Topics
- Character animation
- Pixel art sprites
- Pixellab API integration

## Conversation

### User
Open the project, Tank's Adventure. It may be called Tarzan's Adventure now, I'm not sure. It's a personal project.

### Assistant
Found the project at `/home/alex/projects/balexbrownii/tank-adventure-game` - it's called "Tarzan's Great Adventure" (renamed from Tank Adventure). Opened the project and reviewed its structure.

The project is a Phaser 3 point-and-click adventure game built with TypeScript and deployed to Vercel.

### User
Commit those uncommitted changes

### Assistant
Reviewed the uncommitted changes:
- `public/assets/images/characters/tarzan.png` - Optimized from 984KB to 475KB
- `tarzan_metadata.json` - Updated metadata
- `scripts/generate_art.py` - Minor update
- `src/scenes/BrazilForestScene.ts` - Machete sprite positioning:
  - Moved from (655, height-175) to (750, height-80)
  - Increased scale from 0.08 to 0.18
  - Increased depth from 5 to 90

Committed with message: "fix: Adjust machete sprite positioning and optimize Tarzan asset"

### User
Yes push it

### Assistant
Pushed to origin/main successfully.

### User
What's the vercel url for this

### Assistant
Found the Vercel deployment URL: https://tank-adventure-game.vercel.app/

### User
All of the text still mentions Tank, not Tarzan, unfortunately. Should we just switch the characters to some sort of more pixelated art because it's not animating them whatsoever. You've been prompted multiple times to animate the characters and their movements. Would it be easier if there were sprites or pixelated images of the characters which were fairly detailed, as opposed to the images that are being used now? They definitely need to be animated.

### Assistant
Addressed two issues:

**1. Tank → Tarzan Text Renaming**
Updated remaining "Tank" references in:
- `TitleScene.ts` - Title and subtitle
- `index.html` - Page title

**2. Animation Options - Pixel Art Sprites**

Outlined the path to animated characters:

**Current State:**
- Static painted images (`tarzan.png`, `pig.png`, `mr_snuggles.png`)
- No walk cycles or idle animations
- 1990s painted adventure game style

**Proposed Solution: Pixel Art Sprite Sheets**
Benefits:
- Easier to animate (frame-based)
- Multiple frames per action (idle, walk left, walk right)
- Phaser 3 has excellent sprite sheet support

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Generate or create pixel art sprite sheets (32x32 or 64x64 per frame)
2. Include frames for: idle, walk-left, walk-right, walk-up, walk-down
3. Configure Phaser animations with `this.anims.create()`
4. Switch from `Phaser.GameObjects.Image` to `Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite`

**Tool Options:**
- **Pixellab MCP** - AI-generated sprite sheets with walk cycles
- **Aseprite** - Manual pixel art creation
- **OpenGameArt** - Free sprite sheets

### User
Option 1

### Assistant
Set up Pixellab MCP server for AI-generated sprite sheets.

**Added to `.env.local`:**
```
PIXELLAB_API_KEY=b1d103f1-c963-41e4-9d48-4662e0ead6aa
```

**MCP Server Configuration:**
Added Pixellab to `~/.claude/mcp.json` to enable AI-powered sprite generation.

**Pixellab Capabilities:**
- Generate character sprites from text descriptions
- Create walk cycle animations (8 directional frames)
- Style control (retro pixel art, modern, etc.)
- Export as sprite sheets for Phaser 3

**Next Steps:**
1. Use Pixellab to generate Tarzan sprite sheet with walk cycle
2. Generate matching Pig and Mr. Snuggles sprite sheets
3. Update Phaser scenes to use animated sprites
4. Configure walk animations for WASD movement

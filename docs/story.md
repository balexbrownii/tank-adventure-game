# Tarzan's Great Adventure - Story Bible

## Overview

Tarzan is a super-strong but hilariously "not smart" jungle man who travels from Brazil to Canada with two companions: a talking pig with a Western/cowboy accent, and a deer named Mr. Snuggles.

## The Core Concept

Tarzan's "dumbness" is actually a superpower:
- He's immune to poison because he doesn't know it's poisonous
- He gets power-ups from destroying cars because he thinks they're monsters
- He can walk through dangerous situations unharmed due to blissful ignorance
- His simple worldview often leads to surprisingly effective solutions

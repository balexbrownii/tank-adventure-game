# Tank's Great Adventure - Story Bible

## Overview

Tank is a super-strong but hilariously "not smart" female martial artist who travels from Brazil to Canada with two companions: a talking pig with a Western/cowboy accent, and a deer named Mr. Snuggles.

## The Core Concept

Tank's "dumbness" is actually a superpower:
- She's immune to poison because she doesn't know it's poisonous
- She gets power-ups from destroying cars because she thinks they're monsters
- She can walk through dangerous situations unharmed due to blissful ignorance
- Her simple worldview often leads to surprisingly effective solutions
